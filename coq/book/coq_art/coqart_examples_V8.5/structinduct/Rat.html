<h1>  About the danger of axioms </h1>

Consider the following <a href="SRC/Rat_prelude.v">  definition </a>
 of positive rational numbers, including an axiom stating
that  if <em>ad=bc</em>, then <em>a/b=c/d</em>. 
<br>
Show that this theory is unconsistent.

<a href="SRC/Rat.v"> Solution </a>

<h2> Notes </h2>
We hope that this exercise will warn you against the danger of 
putting axioms in your theories. If you don't leave your <em>Coq</em> session
immediately, please type the following command :
<pre>
Reset eq_RatPlus.
</pre>
to get a consistent environment.
<br><br>
A possible way to get a theory of rational numbers is to replace <em>Coq</em>'s
equality by an equivalence relation. Please look at <em>Setoids</em>  in
<em>Coq</em>'s  documentation.
