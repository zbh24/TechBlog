<h1> Proving that lists are not permutations using reflection
</h1>

<p>
Using the notion of permutations defined in <a href="../inductive-prop-chap/perms.html">this exercise</a>
and the counting function defined in <a href="../progav/moreperms.html">
this exercise</a>.
show that if a list is a permutation of another list, then any natural number 
occurs as many times in both lists.
</p>
<p>
Build a specialized reflection tactic ``<tt>NoPerm \(n\)</tt>'' that solve goals
of the form <tt>~perm l l'</tt> by finding an element of the first
list that does not occur the same number of times in both lists.
