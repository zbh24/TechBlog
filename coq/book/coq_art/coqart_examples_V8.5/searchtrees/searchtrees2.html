<h1>  Changing inductive definitions  </h1>
In <a href="SRC/searchtrees.v"> searchtrees.v </a>, the predicates
<tt>min</tt> and <tt>maj</tt> are inductively defined with the help
of the predicate <tt>occ</tt>.
Give another definition, whithout using <tt>occ</tt>, and compare
the ease of
development in the two approaches. You should be able to redo the all
development with the new definitions.
<h2>Solution</h2>
<a href="SRC/searchtrees2.v"> This file </a> contains some lemmas
which establish the relationship between both  definitions. You should be
able to build a development similar to <a href="searchtrees.v"> using
these lemmas.
