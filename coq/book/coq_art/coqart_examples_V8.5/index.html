<font color=red> Warning! </font> Some solutions we propose don't work
on versions prior to V8.1gamma.

<h2>  New Exercises !  </h2>
These exercises were written after the release of the book (May 2004).
The solution of some of them (e.g. <a href="newstuff/mergesort.html"> mergesort
</a>) illustrates new features of <tt>Coq</tt>. For instance, command
<tt>Function</tt> and tactic <tt>functional induction</tt>.

<h2> Sources and exercises from the book  </h2>
This site contains the source of all examples and the solution of 
170 over 200 exercises from the book. Some new exercises are still added

For each exercise, we give a solution as a <tt>Coq</tt> file, together with
some comments if the exercise is difficult, or if the solution presents some
methodological interest. Comments are welcome.
