<h1> On permutations </h1>

Define the following relationships on <tt>(list A)</tt>:
<ul>
<li> The list <em>l'</em> is obtained from <em>l</em> by transposing two consecutive
    items.
<li> The list <em>l'</em> is obtained from <em>l</em> by a finite number of such transpositions. <em> We say that <em>l'</em> is a permutation of <em>l</em>.
</ul>

Show that the second one is an equivalence relation.

<h2> Solution </h2>

Look at <a href="SRC/perms.v"> this file </a>

<h3> Note </h3>
You could also define the relationship <tt>perm</tt> as
<tt>(Rstar _ transpose)</tt>. In this case, you first have
to load the module <tt>Rstar</tt> of the library <tt>Relations</tt>,
and prove that the reflexive transitive closure of a symmetric relation
is symmetric too.
