l methods

####概念
- Lightweight Formal Methods
  - Specification language
    - Formal methods:   
      formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques
      for the specification, development and verification of software and
      hardware systems.
      - Type system
        - LCF


          ####Semantics 
          - Denotational semantics
            expressed in the mathematical theory of domains
            - Operational semantics
               expressed in  a sequence of actions of a (presumably) simpler
               computational model
               - Axiomatic semantics
                  expressed in terms of preconditions and postconditions which
                  are true before and after the system performs a task,
                  respectively
                   The canonical example of axiomatic semantics is Hoare logic.
                    
                     
                      Lightweight formal methods:
                       As an alternative, various lightweight formal methods,
                       which emphasize partial specification and focused
                       application, have been proposed.
